## Simulation, Verification & Validation (SVV) of an aircraft numerical model

This repository contains a coding assignment. The task is to develop the numerical simulation of an aircraft and compare the dynamic response to real flight data. The model is constructed with a state-space representation for *symmetric* and one for *asymmetric flight*.

The following eigenmotions were recorded during the flight and are analysed in this code:
- Short Period
- Phugoid
- Aperiodic Roll
- Dutch Roll
- Spiral

## Libraries:
- control
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
